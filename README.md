# sprite editor

## What is this?

For the [Canvas-based RPG game](http://github.com/mcmire/rpg) that
[@levicole](http://github.com/levicole) and I are working on, we needed a way to
create images for sprites and background tiles. The thing is, most image editors
really aren't that great at editing pixels. We needed something that was 1)
simple and 2) fast. So why not a simple little tool that runs in the browser?

Current progress on Heroku here: <http://mcmire-sprite-editor.heroku.com>

## Setting things up

Bundler is being used to load the few dependencies this app has at runtime, so
you'll want to make sure you have that installed, then run:

    bundle install

## Running

In order for the load image functionality to work, this app has to be backed by
a web server. We're just using Sinatra, so to boot the app all you have to say
is:

    bundle exec rackup -p PORT

Now visit <http://localhost:PORT>, and you're off to the races. There's
instructions within the app, feel free to play around.

## Developing

Sass is being used for stylesheets. To play nice with Sinatra, CSS files are
generated and stored in the repo. It would be a pain to do this manually, so
[Guard](http://github.com/guard/guard) monitors the `app/stylesheets` directory,
and when you update a Sass file, the corresponding CSS file is generated.
Additionally, since we use CoffeeScript, when you update a CoffeeScript file,
the corresponding JavaScript will be generated. Finally, the test file
corresponding to the CoffeeScript file will be run. *(UPDATE 13 Feb 2012 -- this
doesn't seem to be working at the moment, see the Testing section below)*

So, before you start writing code, simply run:

    bundle exec guard

## Testing

I've actually done a pretty good job of writing tests as I've gone along. I
know, surprising, right?

I am using Jasmine as the test framework, and
[jasmine-headless-webkit](https://github.com/johnbintz/jasmine-headless-webkit)
to run the tests (this allows me to run the tests headlessly using Guard). So
to run the tests you can simply run:

    bundle exec jasmine-headless-webkit spec/javascripts

**UPDATE 13 Feb 2012:** Or at least you could be able to at one point, but that
doesn't seem to work anymore. Just use the jasmine gem:

  bundle exec jasmine

Now, go to http://localhost:8888.

## Architecture

Except for a few images, the sprite editor is built entirely using Javascript,
CSS, and the HTML5 Canvas API.

One thing you need to know is that instead of using jQuery, we've opted to use a
collection of microframeworks, packaged together using
[Ender](http://ender.no.de). Probably this is not totally necessary, as I
haven't bother to optimize the sprite editor yet, but I think the idea Ender
brings to the table is pretty neat, so I'm trying it out. While working with
several modules is a bit more cumbersome, the reduced size of these
microframeworks compared to jQuery is very encouraging (as an example, our
package measures 70kb compared to jQuery 1.5.2, which is 221kb!).

The concatened version of the package we are using is located at
javascripts/ender.js for you to inspect. It's important to note that these
modules approximate, but don't exactly match, the jQuery API. You'll want to
read up on each one. Here's the full list of modules in our package:

* [domReady](http://github.com/ded/domready) - A cross-browser domReady. With
  Ender, this is available as `$.domReady(function() { ... })`.
* [Bonzo](http://github.com/ded/bonzo) + [Qwery](http://github.com/ded/qwery) -
  A DOM utility library and DOM selector engine. With Ender, you can say e.g.
  `$('div > p).hide()`, `$('<div />).attr("id", "foo")`, etc.
* [Bean](http://github.com/ded/bean) - DOM event library. With Ender, you can
  say e.g. `$('div').bind('click', function() { ... })`,
  `$(window).trigger('customevent')`, etc.
* [Emil√©](http://github.com/madrobby/emile) - DOM animation library. With Ender
  you can say e.g. `$('div').animate({opacity: 1, duration: 0.3})`,
  `$('p').fadeIn()`, `$('p').fadeOut()`, etc.
* [Reqwest](http://github.com/ded/reqwest) - Utility library for making Ajax
  requests. With Ender, you can say e.g. `$.ajax({url: ..., type: ..., success:
  ..., failure: ...})`
* [klass](http://github.com/ded/klass) - Utility library for expressively
  creating classes. With Ender, you can say e.g. `$.klass(function() { ...
  }).statics(...).methods(...)`.
* [Valentine](http://github.com/ded/valentine) - General purpose utility
  library. This is basically along the same lines as Underscore, so you can say
  e.g. `$.v.each(function() { ... })`, `$.v.map(function() { ... })`, etc. There
  are a few methods in Underscore that Valentine doesn't have, and the type
  checking methods that Valentine has are a different API than Underscore. Most
  importantly, the callback passed to `each()` is called with different
  arguments in Valentine than Underscore. It's a bit confusing actually: for an
  array, it uses the native `forEach()`, so it's `callback(elem, idx, ary)`, but
  for an object, it's `callback(key, val, obj)`. Perhaps a later update will
  correct this.

The HSL part of the color picker was stolen from <http://hslpicker.com> (source
[here](https://github.com/imathis/hsl-color-picker/)). I really like that a lot.
