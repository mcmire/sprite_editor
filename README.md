# sprite editor *(to be renamed)*

Making pixels fun to work with... since about a week ago.

## Running

All the gems that this app requires are cached in `vendor/cache`, so you shouldn't have to install anything.

You'll need to launch a web server to run the app itself. Technically, you don't need to do this, but the app makes Ajax requests to itself and this only works if it's being run through a web server (otherwise you get a same-origin violation). To do this, run:

    bundle exec serve PORT

Now visit http://localhost:PORT.

## Developing

Sass is being used for stylesheets (but of course). [Guard](http://github.com/guard/guard) gives you a way to regenerate CSS files when you update corresponding Sass files. So, simply run:

    bundle exec guard

Now, develop away!

## Architecture

Except for a few images, the sprite editor is built entirely using Javascript, CSS, and the HTML5 Canvas API.

As mentioned before, [Sass](http://sass-lang.org) is being used to generate CSS.

As for the Javascript, instead of using jQuery, I've opted to use a collection of microframeworks, packaged together using [Ender](http://ender.no.de). Probably this is not totally necessary, as I haven't bother to optimize the sprite editor yet, but I think the idea Ender brings to the table is pretty neat, so I'm trying it out. While working with several modules is a bit more cumbersome, the reduced size of these microframeworks compared to jQuery is very encouraging (as an example, our package measures 70kb compared to jQuery 1.5.2, which is 221kb!).

The concatened version of the package we are using is located at javascripts/ender.js for you to inspect. It's important to note that these modules approximate, but don't exactly match, the jQuery API. You'll want to read up on each one. Here's the module list:

* [domReady](http://github.com/ded/domready) - A cross-browser domReady. With Ender, this is available as `$.domReady(function() { ... })`.
* [Bonzo](http://github.com/ded/bonzo) + [Qwery](http://github.com/ded/qwery) - A DOM utility library and DOM selector engine. With Ender, you can say e.g. `$('div > p).hide()`, `$('<div />).attr("id", "foo")`, etc.
* [Bean](http://github.com/ded/bean) - DOM event library. With Ender, you can say e.g. `$('div').bind('click', function() { ... })`, `$(window).trigger('customevent')`, etc.
* [Emil√©](http://github.com/madrobby/emile) - DOM animation library. With Ender you can say e.g. `$('div').animate({opacity: 1, duration: 0.3})`, `$('p').fadeIn()`, `$('p').fadeOut()`, etc.
* [Reqwest](http://github.com/ded/reqwest) - Utility library for making Ajax requests. With Ender, you can say e.g. `$.ajax({url: ..., type: ..., success: ..., failure: ...})`
* [klass](http://github.com/ded/klass) - Utility library for expressively creating classes. With Ender, you can say e.g. `$.klass(function() { ... }).statics(...).methods(...)`.
* [Valentine](http://github.com/ded/valentine) - General purpose utility library. This is basically along the same lines as Underscore, so you can say e.g. `$.v.each(function() { ... })`, `$.v.map(function() { ... })`, etc. There are a few methods in Underscore that Valentine doesn't have, and the type checking methods that Valentine has are a different API than Underscore. Also, the `each()` method is backwards in Valentine than Underscore -- for arrays, it's `i, e`, for hashes it's `k, v` (this is actually the same as jQuery).

## Resources

The HSL part of the color picker was stolen from http://hslpicker.com (source [here](https://github.com/imathis/hsl-color-picker/)). I really like that a lot.
